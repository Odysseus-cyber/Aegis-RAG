## Tier 5: Edge Cases and Clarification Scenarios

### Prompt 5.1 – Portfolio Manager Beneficial Owners
**Query:** "If a customer is a portfolio manager with multiple underlying investors, does the bank need to perform CDD on all investors?"

**Expected Answer:**
- The underlying investors would technically be beneficial owners
- However, authority recognizes bank may not be able to perform CDD on all due to commercial confidentiality
- Bank should evaluate risks in each case and determine appropriate measures
- Bank may consider applying simplified CDD to underlying investors if criteria met
- Exception: If customer falls within paragraph 6.16 (certain regulated entities), bank is exempted from inquiring about underlying investors

**Category:** CDD Special Cases | **Difficulty:** Edge case | **Notes:** Tests nuanced understanding of beneficial owner rules

- Yes, if the relationship is managed in substance by Singapore staff
- MAS looks at substance of relationship management as a whole
- Even if account is booked overseas for bookkeeping, CDD is required if managed from Singapore
- Alternative: May rely on CDD performed by related entity or other branch if adequate
- The key is the substance of relationship management, not the technical booking location

**Category:** CDD Jurisdictional | **Difficulty:** Edge case | **Notes:** Tests understanding of practical CDD application

---

### Prompt 5.3 – Credit Card Customer Classification
**Query:** "Who is considered the 'customer' for CDD purposes when a bank issues corporate credit cards?"

---

## Tier 6: Negative Cases and "What NOT to Do"

### Prompt 6.1 – Insufficient CDD
**Query:** "A customer who is a publicly listed company on a regulated stock exchange is exempted from beneficial owner verification. Does this mean no further ML/TF risk analysis is needed?"

**Expected Answer (What NOT to do):**
- **Incorrect:** Assuming the exemption from beneficial owner verification equals automatic low-risk determination
- **Correct:** The exemption does NOT constitute adequate analysis of low ML/TF risks for applying simplified CDD
- **What to do instead:** Still perform full CDD and risk assessment; exemption is narrow and applies only to beneficial owner identification

**Category:** Common Misconceptions | **Difficulty:** Moderate

---

### Prompt 6.2 – Minimal Ongoing Monitoring
**Query:** "Our bank performs CDD once when a customer opens an account. Is that sufficient?"

**Expected Answer (What NOT to do):**

- **Correct:** Ongoing monitoring is fundamental to effective AML/CFT management
- **Requirements:** Continuous monitoring adjusted by risk profile, periodic CDD reviews (annual for high-risk), trigger event updates
- **Consequences:** Failure to maintain current CDD data prevents identification of risk profile changes

**Category:** Common Misconceptions | **Difficulty:** Easy

## Performance Metrics to Track

When testing these prompts, monitor:

1. **Retrieval Quality**
   - Are the top-K chunks semantically relevant?
   - Does the retriever distinguish between different CDD requirements vs. other risk management?
   - Multi-turn: Does rewritten query capture conversation context?

2. **Generation Quality**
   - Does response directly answer the question?
   - Are multiple aspects covered for complex questions?
   - Response length appropriate for question complexity?

3. **Citation Accuracy**
   - Do cited sections actually contain the information provided?
   - Sections referenced are accurate?

4. **Edge Case Handling**
   - Nuanced questions answered correctly (not over-simplified)?
   - Negative cases properly qualified?
   - Exceptions explained clearly?

## Expected Retrieval and Generation Performance

### High Confidence (Should Get Right)
- Tier 1 prompts: 95%+ success
- Clear factual questions with direct document references

### Medium Confidence (May Need Refinement)
- Tier 2-3 prompts: 80-90% success
- Requires synthesis across multiple sections or understanding of nuance
- May need prompt engineering or reranking improvements

### Lower Confidence (Good for Drift Detection)
- Tier 4 multi-turn: 70-85% success
- Depends on query rewriting quality and multi-turn context handling
- Tier 5-6 edge cases: 60-80% success
- Tests system's ability to handle exceptions and nuance

---

## Suggested Testing Order

1. **Phase 1:** Run all Tier 1 prompts (simple retrieval baseline)
2. **Phase 2:** Run Tier 2 & 3 single-turn prompts (moderate complexity)
3. **Phase 3:** Run multi-turn conversations (Tier 4)
4. **Phase 4:** Edge cases and negative cases (Tier 5-6)
5. **Phase 5:** Manual testing with scenarios A-E

After initial run, use scores to identify:
- Weak sections of document (poor retrieval)
- LLM failure modes (poor generation despite good retrieval)
- Query rewriting issues (multi-turn failures)
- Document ingestion issues (chunking, metadata)
